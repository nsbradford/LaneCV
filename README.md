## Usage

Note that you'll need OpenCV compiled with FFMPEG support in order to load videos.

    $ python runner.py

### Protobuf compilation

After modifying the `lanecv.proto` definition, use `protoc` to recompile the python and java files.

    $ cd ./lanecv/proto
    $ protoc -I=. --python_out=. lanecv.proto
    $ protoc -I=. --java_out=.  lanecv.proto 

## Overview

Initialize by creating a MetaModel, perspectiveMatrix, and backgroundSubtractor. Open the video, and for each frame, update the metamodel state using the results of laneDetection(). A MetaModel is composed of two ParticleFilterModel instances, each of which track a single LineModel. The MetaModel receives updates in the form of a MultiModel (two LineModel instances).

### Completed

* Literature review: Approach is always 1) filter to extract lines, 2) form initial naive hypothesis, 3) fit complex curve with RANSAC, all while limiting search space with simplifying assumptions (e.g. lane is forwards)
* Python demo: hard-coded perspective projection, background subtraction (remove propeller motion), yellow extraction (works much better than edges)
* Sequential RANSAC for multiple lines
* Particle filter for line models
* Protobuf for sending multi-line models


### Assumptions

* Each lane can be approximated as a single line in form [offset, orientation] from the nose of the plane.
* There will never be more than 2 lanes in a single frame (could be changed by adding another step to fitLines() and extending the MetaModel).
* The runway is a flat surface (used for perspective transform).
* The taxiway lane markings are clearly defined yellow.
* The plane motion is reasonably slow (required for background subtraction of the properller, as well as proper particle filtering).

## TODO

### Priorities

* Filtering
    * Fix offset calculation (obvious when displayingâ€¦)
    * Reset ParticleFilterModel after evidence stops being collected
        * This is causing the models to swap positions
        * Use default particle filter settings to tell whether or not lanes is appearing/disappearing- prevents hardcoding of edge cases
* Protobuf
    * Java integration

### Exploration

* Build model with prior distribution given Airport model
* Fit complex B-snake/spline/curve to yellow-extraction
    * Need to define search space...

###  Backlog

* Optimize to reduce needless image copying
* Increase dilation and increase resolution
* Perspective Transform: widen field, expand upwards to horizon
* Try using ridges/edges instead of color (fails under extreme curves)
* Video Stabilization with Visual Odometry (hard)


## Protobuf steps

* Installed pre-built binary protoc-3.2.0-osx-x86_64.zip from https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.2.0
